# SR2 Dashboard

Mod for slowroads.io (2.x) that:
- displays pressed inputs on screen


## How to run

When in the game, either run the script found in [`bookmark.js`](bookmark.js) in the console, or create a bookmarklet with the same script set as the URL (BUT including the `javascript:`!), and click on that bookmarklet to run it. Which script you need is marked in the file.

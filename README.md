# slowroads-mod

Mod for slowroads.io.
It includes the following:
- Time and distance on road display (including highscores for both measured values)
- AWD/FWD switch hotkey
- Boost status display


## How to run
Run the script (without the `javascript:` in front) in the console, or create a bookmark with the one-liner as the URL (including the `javascript:`) and click on that.
This script remaps the debug menu shortcut to F2. If you already had the shortcut key configured as F2, please change it to another key first before running the script.

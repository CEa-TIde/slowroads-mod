# slowroads-mod

Mod for slowroads.io.
It includes the following:
- Time and distance on road display (including highscores for both measured values)
- AWD/FWD switch hotkey
- Boost status display


## How to run
Run the script (without the `javascript:` in front) in the console, or create a bookmark with the one-liner as the URL (including the `javascript:`) and click on that.
This script remaps the debug menu shortcut to F2 by default. If you already had the shortcut key configured as F2, please change it to another key first before running the script.

## How to use
You can change the keybinds in the settings (still WIP; at the moment you can remove keybinds and reset to default)
When remapping the debug menu shortcut key (F2 by default), make sure it isn't the same as the normal debug menu shortcut.

You can toggle the visibility of the ui with the toggleUI button (U by default), or toggle each individually with the shortcut keys (digit keys by default).
